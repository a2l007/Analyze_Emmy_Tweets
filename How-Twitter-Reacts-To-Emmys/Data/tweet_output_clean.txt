disappointed not to win an emmy again this year.
kiiiiinda disappointed with that emmy red carpet. no dress hype from me.
i'm not okay with @mssarahpaulson not winning at least one emmy. her character on ahs was the most complicated of all. disappointed #emmys
emmy's, you had one job. disappointed. still woke up chuckling thanks to #piggate though...
really disappointed with the #emmy tonight! #boardwalkempire should've won! half of the show that won wasn't that great. #disappointed
saw @nancyleegrahn tweet about @violadavis emmy speech &amp; thought it was a hoax. nope. disappointed too b/c i loved me some alexis on #gh.
also disappointed tituss didnt win his emmy because we could have had a rendition of pinot noir.
i have this strange feeling when i am so happy viola davis got the emmy but so disappointed for tatiana maslany who truly deserved it too.
this year i was happy with all the #emmys2015 nominations. i'm disappointed with all the winners. sounds about right.[emmy is the new oscar]
i'm so disappointed tatiana reaaally deserved that emmy
congrats on the emmy viola davis! @violadavis great show, so disappointed when the season ended.. @howtogetawayabc
so disappointed lena headey didnt win an emmy, she so deserved it, she was the best part of game of thrones this season
i'm a little bit disappointed by the emmy results this year. :/
i'm so disappointed for tatiana. viola is a great actress but seriously tatiana deserved this emmy
so i watched the emmy awards and was disappointed.
disappointed about no #emmy for @sho_shameless! #emmys2015
disappointed that tatiana maslany didnt get the emmy .
her performance was much better than the rest, 11 times better to be exact
#cloneclub
@ladailynews @insidesocalent disappointed the #emmy's would not keep "political satire" out of the awards. #overit
@johncanzanobft knight &amp; helfrich won ur sports emmy's?yuck. r u on their payroll yet? was bound to happen. u will be disappointed next week
tried to watch emmy awards to see what the fuss is about. couldn't find it on our super-basic cable plan. not disappointed.
@tatianamaslany is the best actres, i feel disappointed when i heard that the emmy was not for her.
can't say i'm not disappointed that bloodline didn't get any love at the emmy's this year. one of my absolute favorites! #bloodline #netflix
@carlaandthecity: #emmy 2015 disappointed that @tatianamaslany did not win for best lead actress! she's amazing and has such range.
@tatianamaslany didn't win the #emmy &amp; i'm so disappointed. i think she was robbed. probably not the only one #cloneclub
i'm disappointed that jonathan banks didn't win the emmy. @bettercallsaul
disappointed that the final run of #madmen lost the #emmy to #got. but thrilled to see #tracymorgan back on his feet &amp; cracking everyone up
viola davis is a fine actress &amp; deserves the emmy. i'm just disappointed that the opportunity for women like us has taken so long.#emmy
let the people speak for themselves. disappointed in the emmy's voting tonight all around the board.
extremely disappointed that peeno noir didn't win an emmy
i'm #disappointed that @tatianamaslany didn't win an #emmy tonight. she deserves like 10 of them. #orphanblack
@st_lifetweets @stcom disappointed cuz tatiana maslany deserved an emmy more than anyone else
a little disappointed that @tatianamaslany didn't win an emmy but at least she got nominated and had a hilarious segment on the show!
@justinaclin disappointed jon has mad mens only emmy.
watched all of the emmy's because i thought charlie hunnam was nominated but was severely disappointed
i just saw the entire emmy show im a bit disappointed
disappointed
better call saul shut out
of emmy's, being nominated for season 1 on 3 counts is still something. next year! #bettercallsaul
disappointed with the emmy outcome. @tatianamaslany deserved to win.
so p&amp;r relatively never won an emmy and i'm generally disappointed bc there was so much potential and ppl ignored it
highly disappointed that parks and rec didn't win an #emmy. such a great show and so sad that it's over !
@marcuslemonis didn't get an emmy this year? @cnbc @theprofitcnbc why? the profit is brilliant &amp; educational tv. #disappointed #emmys
disappointed that tatiana maslany didn't win the emmy, but viola davis is absolutely a worthy winner!
come on! @madmen_amc should've had the #emmy for best drama series! very disappointed...
no #bestdrama #emmy for #madmen. disappointed in you, television academy
where is my emmy for staying up late to be disappointed
i am so disappointed in all of the emmy's that @ahsfx didn't get. what even is olive kitridge?

i'm disappointed that tatiana maslany didn't win an emmy
somewhat disappointed carol ann susi was featured on the emmy's "in memorium".
still disappointed that this emmy is for mad men and not for is work in the snl sketch "jon hamm's john ham"
so disappointed that @jonathan banks did not win best supporting actor #emmy #bettercallsaul
jon was well deserving of that emmy. congrats!!! i have to admit that i am a little disappointed that jimmy didn't win though!!
disappointed about jonathan bank not winning the emmy. i thought he was the guy.
are you winning or losing? whether you're celebrating or disappointed, we've got you covered. @nfl @emmy
not going to lie i'm disappointed that @smrtgrls didn't win. leslie knope is a character that should have a emmy win.
disappointed @iamlenaheadey didn't win #emmy but congrats to uzo aduba
thoroughly disappointed in my emmy livecastin' snickerstream. feed is wack y'all let me down
i'm kind of disappointed margo martindale wasn't animated when they showed her #emmy nomination @bojackhorseman
ok who the fuck gave game of thrones a writing emmy. i'm not mad, just disappointed.
i'm not surprised that jon stewart won the emmy award for variety series, but i'm pretty disappointed that david letterman didn't win.
i'm disappointed that amy poehler never won an emmy for parks and recreation, she really deserved it
surprised and disappointed #keyandpeele didn't win that emmy. such a fantastic show with such clever, funny and imaginative skits. best show

i am disappointed that @iamqueenlatifah didn't win an emmy for her outstanding performance in @hbo bessie. #emmys2015 #bessie
a little disappointed, since fred savage introduced the segment, that daniel stern didn't do the voiceover for the final episodes bit. #emmy
kinda disappointed that @mssarahpaulson didn't win a emmy for #americanhorrorstory #emmys
@jessfazari so disappointed i switched from dull emmy to duller football.

frances mcdormand always seems disappointed. she just won an emmy &amp; i feel like apologizing for having 4 slices of cheese for dinner #emmys

i'm going to be very disappointed if tatiana maslany doesn't win an emmy.
